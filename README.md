# Personal-Site

Personal Site: Portfolio hosted on github pages
This is my (Tito) personal portfolio website. It is aliving document that is intended to change over time, with periodic additions being added as my body of work grows. The code is freely available for anyone else who wishes to use it as a template for their own web page.

This draft of a website is in an early iteration and intend to have more script/app functionality as time goes on.
